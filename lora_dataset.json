PRINCIPLES AND PURPOSES OF THE POLICY\n1.1. Higher Education Institutions (\"HEIS\"J are highly consequential institutions in\nsociety that are dedicated to the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge.\nMembers of the HEI community have several important rights and privileges,\ncentral among which is the right to pursue inquiry and search for knowledge\nwithout hinderance from unlawful or otherwise unacceptable constraints. The\nHigher Education Commission (the \"HEC\"), which has been mandated by law to\nprescribe conditions under which HEIs in the country may be opened and\noperated, takes very seriously the freedom of teachers, researchers, scholars,\nstudents and other members of the HEI community to live and work in a safe\nenvironment in which their dignity is protected.\n1.2. Protection against sexual harassment is important not only because it threatens\nthe freedom and conduciveness of the environment at institutions of higher\nlearning. At a more fundamental level, such conduct is unacceptable because it\nviolates personal dignity and shall not be tolerated at HEIs in Pakistan under\nany circumstance.\n1.3. In accordance with the terms of this poliry, sexual harassment shall be\nprohibited at HEls in Pakistan, and shall constitute a punishable offence under\nthe poliry. The HEC affirms the right of every member of the HEI community\nlive, study and work in an environment that is free from sexual harassment. The\ngoal ofthis policy is to prevent sexual harassment from taking place, and where\nnecessary to act upon complaints of sexual harassment promptly, fairly,\njudiciously and with due regard to confidentiality for all parties concerned.\n1.4. All administrators, deans, managers, faculty, department chairs, directors of\nschools or programs and others in supervisory or leadership positions have an\nobligation to be familiar with and to uphold this policy and its procedures along\nwith informing members oftheir staff about its existence. HEIs are encouraged\nto formulate internal policies that further strengthen or expand the protections\navailable under the HEC's policy on sexual harassment.\n1.5. This poticy has been made pursuant to the powers granted to the HEC under the\nHigher Education Commission 0rdinance, 2002, and is binding on all higher\neducation institutions in the country, whether operating in the public or private\nsectors. Violations or failure to comply with the HEC's policies may lead to\nregulatory action being taken against non-compliant HEIs.\n1.6. This policy is consistentwith and has been made in light ofthe provisions ofthe\nProtection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010 (as\namended) (the \"2010 Harassment Act'). It extends the protection against\nsexual harassment to all members of the HEI community, and provides the\noption to aggrieved persons to seek recourse to resources within the HEI or to\nseek redressal through the provisions ofthe 2010 Act.\n2, PRoHIBITED CoNDUcr\n2.1. \"sexual harassment\" means any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual\nfavors or other verbal or written communication or physical conduct ofa sexual\nnature, or sexually demeaning attitudes, where:\n4aJ Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term\nor condition ofan individual participation in any activity at the HEI;\nb) Submission to or reiection of such conduct by an individual is used as a\nbasis for academic or employment decision affecting that individual; or\nc) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with\nan individual's academic or work performance, or of creating an\nintimidating hostile, or offensive educational or working environment.\n2,2. Sexual harassment may be oveft or subtle, and can range from visual signals or\ngestures to verbal abuse to physical contact along with hand or sign language to\ndenote sexual activity, persistent and unwelcome flirting (see Annex l for\nexamples of various manifestationsJ.\n2.3. The following behaviors are specifically prohibited under this policy. This\nfollowing are meant to provide specificity to the definition provided in clauses\n2.1. However, it is not an exhaustive list, and other behaviors that fall within the\nscope ofthe definition above shall also be prohibited.\na) Especially Egregious Non-Consensual Acts: Acts that would be included\nin the category of rape. While such situations will be covered under the\nlaws of the country, and law enforcement institutions and the courts will\ninvestigate and adjudicate accordingly, the HEI administration has a\nspecial obligation to take preventative measures, offer immediate\nassistance and take interim measures when required.\nb) Non-Consensual Sexual Contacti Includes sexual contact with another\nperson without consent.\nc) Sexual Exploitation; Taking of actions that violate the sexual privacy of\nothers or taking sexual advantage of another without their consent. For\nexample, taking pictures, videotaping, viewing or distributing explicit\nimages or sexual information of another person without their consent.\nd) Other Pervasive or Severe Behaviors: It is not necessary that there be\nactual sexual contact for a behavior to be categorized as sexual\nharassment. Other unwelcome behaviors are also prohibited if[iJ they are\nbased on an individual's sex or gender (ii) are persistent or highly serious\nand [iii) create an atmosphere which is intimidating or hostile. These\ninclude but are not limited to lewd remarks or gestures, highly offensive\njokes of a sexual nature, commenting inappropriately about another's\nbody, and stalking.\ne) Sex Discrimination: Adverse treatment of individuals based on their sex\nor gender rather than on merit. This would include instances such as the\nsingling out [for such adverse treatment as lower salary or grades, or\nmore severe punishmentJ ofperson[s] on the basis ofsex or gender.\n2.4. All the actions categorized as sexual harassment when done physically or\nverbally would also be considered as sexual harassment when done\nelectronically such as through the internet, e- mails, social media, texting,\ntelephone, voicemail etc.\n2.5, All actions of harassment or discrimination may be taken by a person of any\ngender against a person ofthe same or another gender, and would need to be\nconsidered by the HEI if the act qualifies as a prohibited act under the policy.\n2.6. Sexual harassment is especially offensive when perpetrated by persons in\nauthority, and when submission is made a condition toward any HEI activity or\nbenefit (for example, when submission is made the basis ofthe evaluation ofan\nindividual).\n2.7. Sexual harassment will be considered especially egregious when the accused\nknew or reasonably should have known that the victim was in an impaired or\nincapacitated state. However, impairment ofthe accused, such as a result ofthe\nuse of any illegal substances, shall not diminish their responsibility for\nharassment under this poliry.\n3IuRIsDrcrroN\nThis policy applies to actions by students, faculty, staff, other members of the\nHEI community fsuch as interns, residents etc.J, or third parties (such as service\nproviders, visitors etc.], when the misconduct occurs:\naJ on the HEI property (i.e. on campus) or in its immediate vicinity;\nbl off the HEI property, if (i) the conduct occurs in connection with an HEI\nrecognized program or activity or (ii) the conduct may create a hostile\nenvironment or pose a safety risk on campus; and\ncJ using the university's computing or network resources accessed from an\noff-campus location, which shall be deemed to have occurred on campus.\nDESTcNATED REsouRcEs\nThe HEI shall designate at least two members of the HEI administration (the\n\"Focal Persons\"J, at least one ofwhom shall be a woman, to offer support and\nimmediate assistance to those who have experienced sexual harassment.\nContact information of such individuals shall be easily available, including on\nthe HEIs website.\nThe HEI shall also constitute an Inquiry Committee to investigate and adjudicate\nany allegations of prohibited conduct (the \"Inquiry Committee\") in accordance\nwith the provisions of Section 7 below, Those who have experienced sexual\nharassment may also contact members of the Inquiry Committee for support\nand advice.3.1.\n4.2.4.\n4.7\n5. CoMPLATNTSANDREPoRTING\n5.1. A complaint may be lodged by any person who has experienced sexual\nharassment as defined in Section 2 [Prohibited Conduct] read with Section 3\nffurisdiction] of this policy, with either the Focal Person or with any member of\nthe Sexual Harassment Inquiry Committee,\n5\n5.2. In cases in which the conduct in question falls within the scope of the 2010\nHarassment Act, the affected person shall also have an option to submit a\ncomplaint to the Ombudsperson in accordance with the provisions ofthe 2010\nHarassment Act.\n5.3. In the event that a complainant is reluctant to contact the Focal Persons or any\nmembers of the Inquiry Committee, the complainant may contact a colleague,\ninstructor, the employment supervisor, manager, department chair, dean or VC.\nIt will be the responsibility ofthe individual contacted to report the case to the\nInquiry Committee without identirying either the complainant or the alleged\noffender and to ask for advice on procedure and policy from them to effect\nsolution, ifa solution is necessary.\n5.4. Complainants shall be encouraged to submit complaints promptly, preferably\nwithin 3 months but no later than 12 months from the last date ofthe alleged\nharassment. An extension ofup to l year may be granted by the Focal Persons\nor the lnquiry Committee upon written request stating the reasons for the delay\nin submitting the complaint.\n5.5. All members ofthe HEI community are encouraged to report any instances of\nsexual harassment that they may have observed to the Focal Persons or the\nlnquiry Committee. For the purposes of safeguarding the campus community,\nHEIs have an obligation to investigate material violations ofthis policy even in\nthe event that a formal complaint has not been filed.\n5.6. As soon as a complaint or report is received by one of the designated resources,\nit shall be shared by him or her (within a period of 24 hours) with all Focal\nPersons and members of the Inquiry Committee for further action.\n5.7. For minor violations, complainants may opt to make an informal complaint to\neither the Focal Person or the Inquiry Committee. The primary obiective of\ninformal resolution mechanism is to take preventative action, so that minor\nviolations are detected early and appropriate warning is given to the accused to\nstop the offending behavior before it reaches a higher degree ofseriousness. If\nthe incident reported through this mechanism constitutes prohibited conduct\nunder Section 2 of this policy, the Inquiry Committee shall deal with the\ncomplaint accordingly.\n6.\n6.1INTERIM MEASURES AND SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS\nAs soon as a complaint or report is received by designated resources or any\nmember ofthe HEI administration, depending on the nature and seriousness of\nthe offence, the Focal Persons shall take appropriate steps to provide interim\nmeasures that may be requested by the affected persons or as otherwise may be\ndeemed appropriate. If the affected person is not satisfied with the measures\ntaken, he or she may contact any member of the Inquiry Committee for\nnecessary action. Interim measures include but are not limited to:\naJ adjustment in class or examination schedules, including for the purposes\nof attending hearings;\n6\nbJ access to counselling services or other appropriate medical assistance;\ncJ change in the work assignments;\nd) arrangement for any assessments or evaluations to be made by a neutral\nperson;\neJ adjustment to class schedule, including withdrawal from course or\nchanging the section;\n0 notifying the campus security officials (or law enforcement in case of\nserious violations) regarding the violation;\ngJ impositions of a HEI wide order designed to prohibit contact or\ncommunication between certain persons;\nh) change of the housing arrangement of certain persons; or\niJ any other measures that may be deemed appropriate.\n7, INQUTRY CoMMITTEE\n7.1.

INTRODUCTION\nThe ORIC at Sukkur IBA University serves as a centralized hub for counseling and suppotting all\ndepartments in their research and development endeavors. Therefore, ORIC plays i ilg.,ifiiur,t\nrole in achieving the university's vision. The mission of ORIC is to facilitate and coordinate\nresearch-related activities across the departrnents and faculties of Sukkur IBA University.\nAdditionally, ORIC actively engages with national and intemational educational, research, and\nindushial organizations to promote research at Sukkur IBA University.\nMission Statement of ORIC\nSupporting the university's skategic research dtections and policies. Increasing and diversifying\nexternal research funding. Improving integraton of research and education it all tevels of theuniversity. Improving translation of research into the public b€nefit. Strengthening university-\nindustry relationships. Promoting entrepreneurship, technology transfer ani comniercialization\nactivities that energize and support the local and national economy. promoting and enhancing\ncrosscutting and multi-disciplinary research initiatives.SUKKUR IBA UMVERSITY has recognized the paramount importance of research right from its\ninception. As part of its mission to become a research-driven institution, the university has actively\nfostered a culture of research and development across all its departments and facultes. [n recent\ntimes, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) has placed great emphasis on guiding\nuniversities to contribute to the economic landscape of the country. The theme of \"UniversitiesBuilding Economies\" has been designated as the focal point of the HEC,s five-year plan. kr light of\nthis, Sukkur IBA University received guidelines from the HEC to establish th; Office of Research,\nIrurovatiory and Commercialization (ORIC). Although some of the essential elements required by\nthe HEC for the formation of oRIC were already in place at the university, there was i need to\nreorganize the existing structure to align precisely with HEC,s requirements. Consequently, the\nreorganization of the research setup prompted a review and enhancement of sukkur IBA\nUniversity's existing Research and Development Policy to address current needs and better\ncoordinate, its functioning. Thus, a new policy document titled ,,Research policy\" has been\nformulated.\n2.\n1MERIT - QUALITY - EXCETTENCE\nR6rf ,-rz/rz\nSukkur IBA University, Airport Road Sukkur-65200, Sindh, Pakistan Tel: +92-71.-5644000 UAN: +92-71 (777-785-4221Fax: +92-71-5804419\nE-mail; info@iba-suk.edu.pk Website: http://www.iba-suk.edu.pk\n3. Goalsof ORIC\nCreating an attractive and motivating environment for conducting research to produce\nhigh quality, relevant and irrrovative products and processes.\nEnsure the availability of excellent physical infrastructure such as library, labs, training\nworkshops, computers etc.\nIdentify sources of funding from different quarters\nEstablish a strong bridge between Sukkur IBA University and the industry to solve the\nindustry problems by conducting relevant research for the industry as part of\ncommercialization.\nTo conduct a need-analysis study of indushy to find their requirements\nGain trust of the industry and prove to them that we do have the capability and knowledge\nto solve their problems.\n4. Experts Panel for Research and Consultancy\nA research panel/pool of experts/committee will be established comprising of following\ncomposition,\n1. Director Postgraduate Studies (Convener)\n2. Director QEC3. Director ORIC\n4. Four faculty members to be recommended by the convener and approved by the Vice\nChancellor\nThe criteria for being a member of this panel for faculty members are as follows:\no Must be a full time SIBAU faculty member\no PhD degree from HEC recognized National University/Degree Awarding\nInstitutes (DAI's) or reputed L:temational University/lrstitution.\no At least five research publications in ISI (Institute of Scientific Information, USA)\nindexed joumals in the past five years.\nThe Experts Panel will perform the following activities:. Guide in compiling list of national and intemational journals & conferences of high lepute\nin all the disciplines currently being offered at Sukkur IBA University and rank them, i.e.,\nA, B, & C category on the basis of their quality, i.e., impact factor & intemational\nreputation.o Review the papers submitted by the faculty members/students of Sukkur IBA University\nfor travel grant or publication fees and make recommendations to the ORIC for\nacceptance/rejection of the request along with detailed feedback/comments for the\napplican ts/ su bmitters.o Oversee and guide the faculty members and students who are actively involved in research\nand provide them necessary facilities, i.e., proof reading facilities, clear, constructive,\ncontinuous, and timely feedback on their research projects/papers, etc.o Monitor the research activities taking place at Sukkur IBA University and promote inter &\nintra depatmental research collaboration by building teams of researchers on the selected\nthemes.o Guide in planning and organizing national and international research conferences on the\nvarious themes related to the disciplines currently being offered at Sukkur IBA University.\n2\nHelp in selecting editor(s), associate editor(s), and reviewer(s) for the editorial board of the\njoumals, being published or likely to be published by the Sukkur IBA University in near\nfuture.\nThe Panel is scheduled to convene at least once per quarter, ensuring a total of four meetings\nyearly. However, the frequency of these meetings may be increased as necessary based on the\nprevailing requirements.\n5. RESEARCHGROUPS\nTo further augment the scope and momentum of R&D activities at Sukkur IBA University, each\ndepartment will set up research group in the areas of their expertise who will be responsible to\ncoordinate, observe and document all R&D related activities of the department in consultation\nwithORIC.\nThe Research group will perform the following activities:\na. Ensuring smooth functioning and effective Management of R&D activities at the\ndepartment level.\nb. Providing a central place in the department to co-ordinate R&D related activities with\nother departments of Sukkur IBA University, faculty members and students.\nc. Identifying possible projects/ sources of funding, and to convey the same to ORIC\nSukkur IBA University.\n6. RATSING RESEARCH PROJECT PROPOSALS\nDefinition of a Research Project - A research project is a planned and systematic endeavor\nundertaken by individuals or a group of researchers to investigate, explore, and contribute new\nknowledge or understanding to a specific area of study. It involves a structured and organized\napproach to gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data to aildress re*arch questions, test hypothews,\nor explore noael concepts.\nA research project typically follows a well-defined methodology, which includes formulating\nresearch objectives, designing a research plan, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing\nconclusions based on the findings. The project may involve various activities such as literature\nreview, data collection (tfuough experirnents, surveys, observations, interviews, etc.), data\nanalysis using statistical or qualitative methods, and the dissemination of research outcomes\nthrough publications or presentations. Furthermore, for a research proiect to be considered as a\nresearch projecf it should either be sponsored through national/intemational funding\norganizations (like HEC, SHEC, PSF etc) or through Sukkur IBA University intemal grant\nmechanism as described later in this document.\nNot considered as research projects:D Quantitative/Qualitative Surveys\n) Web-site/portaldevelopment\n! Creation of Data Banks/Information Repositories\n! Collaborative projects involving student or faculty exchanges without resulting in research\noutcome\n3) Projects for civil work\n7\nA research project be initiated by any member(s) of Sukkur IBA University. The person initiating\nthe project willbe called Principal lnvestigator (PI). It is preferable to have a Co-PI in each project\nwho will assist the PI. In case of a team or group of members initiating a proiect there will be a PI\nand o*rers would be members of his team. The team members can be from other\nUniversities/R&D organizations. Such projects involving a group or team will be preferred\nespecially so if these are multidisciplinary involving more than one Sukkur IBA University\ndepartments as this arrangement ensures continuity in progress and reduces dependency on an\nindividual. For projects whose sponsorship is solicited from external agencies a predetermined\npercentage (from public sector the desirable amount is 10-15% and for private sector 15-25) of the\ntotal cost of the project be charged as \"University Overheads\" to cover the cost incurred by the\nUniversity.\nThe major steps that should me mentioned (written) in submitted research proposal are:o Identification of research problem. Literafure reviewo Specifying the purpose of rese,ucho Determine specific research questions or hypotheses. Data collection. Analyzing and interpreting the datar Reporting and evaluating research\nFollowing are the important considerations as part of Research project proposals:\na. Each faculty member with PhD degree (Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant\nProfessor) must submit at least one research proposal (as PI or Co-PI) for research funding in\na year, to ORIC i.e. from July 1 to June 30, after the enforcement of this policy. [: case, if a\nfaculty member fails to achieve this aspect, the university HR will determine further course of\nactionl\nb. After budgeting university overheads as mentioned above, if the proposal mentions any\nsalary/honorarium for PI, Co-PI or any other role specified clearly in the project budget, only\nthat amount is allowed to be paid to the researchers during the execution of the research\nc. In individual consultancy assignments, disbursement of cash reward, at the end of the project\nexecution, to the PI and Co-PI will depend on overall expenditure and net savings of the\nconsultancy. The division of the eamings eamed after completion of the consultancy, after\ndeducting all operating expense and on approval of the Vice Chancellor Sukkur IBA\nUniversity will be as follows:\na. PI & his/her teal:. 60%\nb. Sukkur IBA University R&D Fund 40%\nd. Such profit sharing is only for those consultancy projects which are won by individual\nresearchers, whereas those proiects which are awarded to the University as a\nfirm/ oryarizanon, no profit sharing is permitted.\ne. For other research projects (like NRPU, SHEC, t€F etc.), shict compliance with the defined\nbudget as mentioned in the relevant research proposal document is advised. Any amount left\nover, after completing the project implementatio4 has to be retumed back to the donor.f. Final decision about such projects is taken by the Vice Chancellor on the recommendation of\nConvener Expert Panel as defined in Section 4 of this document.\nl This condition does not apply to faculty members appointed as professor of practice, associate professor of practice, and\nassistant professor of practice\n4\n7. PUBLICATIONS IN IOURNALSIt is compulsory for faculty members (holding PhD degree) including Professor, Associate\nProfessor and Assistant Professor, to publish technical research articles in journals and conJerences\non regular basis under the name of \"Sukkur IBA University\". Each faculty member is expected to\nproduce research publication(s) (at least one) annually in HEC recognized journal. Order of the\nauthors in a publication to be arranged as per their research contribution. Highest credit will be\ngiven to publications in joumals with high Impact Factor and indexed by Scopus and Web of\nScience. Following are the important considerations as part of Research Publicatioru:\na. Faculty members holding PhD degrees including Professor, Associate Professor\nand Assistant Professor must publish at least one research article in a referred\nintemational joumal in a year, i.e. from July 1 to June 30, after the enforcement of\nthis policy2.\nb. If after the enlorcement of this policy, any faculty member is not successful to\npublish a research article in the first year, then the university HR to determine\nfurther course of action in such cases\n8. FINANCIAL REWARD FOR PUBLICATION\nSukkur IBA University has always encouraged its faculty and students to actively involve\nthemselves in research activities. It has been forthcoming in providing financial support and\nsponsoring the research activities. In this context, encouragement for research publications\nremains a very important aspect of Sukkur IBA University. University will also provide cash\nawards for contribution of its faculty and PhD scholars in publication of their research work. [:\nwhich each faculty member can claim up to PKR 500,000 cash reward in each academic year based\non the nature of his/her publication.\nThe cash reward will be paid to all those publication(s) that has been published in the HEC\nrecognized joumal(s) based on their Joumal Prestige kdex (JPI) according to HJRS by Higher\nEducation Commission of Pakistan, in the following manner:\nD For publication(s) in category'A' joumals;\n. A cash reward of Rs. 50,000 will be paid for JPI 1 to 30\n. A cash reward of Rs. 100,000 will be paid for JPI31 to 60\n. A cash reward of Rs. 150,000 will be paid for JPI61 to 90\n. A cash reward of Rs.200,000 will be paid for JPI>90D No cash reward will be given to the \"B category joumals under HEC Y category (Those\nthey are not indexed by Scopus & ESCD.\nFollowing are the important considerations as part of journal categories:\no Category 'A' joumals will include lmpact Factor (IF) and joumal indexed by Scopus and\nWeb of Science of the respective year.\no Category'B' joumals will include all the joumals that recognized by Higher Education\nCommission (HEC) in Y category and not indexed by Scopus and /ESCI Indexed.\nIt is a well-known fact that the quality of research publications is judged by the Impact Factor of\nthe joumal in which these are pubtshed, therefore, in order to further improve the quality of our\nresearch publications and align the policy with the latest trends, the following are necessary:\na. Research publication under the name of \"Sukkur IBA University\" will only be considered\nfor the award under the policy.\nb. Only authors who are Sukkur IBA University faculty members or PhD students will be\nconsidered for the award.\n2 This condition does not apply to faculty members appointed as professor of practice, associate professor of practice, and\nassistant professor of practice\n5\n9c. ln case of co-authorship, if more than one author is from Sukkur IBA University then the\ncash award will be paid to the fust author (in sequence) from Sukkur IBA University.\nd. In case if an author, later in the sequence is claiming for the reward, in such cases, an NOC\nis required from earlier author in the sequence\ne. The disbursement of the cash reward will be made in the name of the researcher based on\nthe recommendation of the Convener of the Research Panel, as stated in Section 4, and\nsubject to the approval of the Vice Chancellor.\nMEASUREMENT CRITERIA FOR THE CALCULATION OF JOURNAL PRESTIGE INDEX\nOPD\nThe Six measures described below has been used for the calculation of Joumal prestige index by\nHigher Education Commission of Pakistan. and which is retrieved ftorr the website of FIJRSHEC.\na. Eigen Factor (EFT)\nThe Eigen factorrM [EGF] score of a joumal is an estimate of the percentage of time that library\nusers spend with that joumal. This factor measures the prestige of a Joumal because with a\nprestigious joumal, researchers will spend more time. We will display its raw value (EGFRaw)\nand the percentile value (EGFp).\nb. Article Influence (AI$\nThe Article lnfluence ScorerM (AIF) for each joumal is a measure of the per-article citation inJluence\nof the journal. This tells us that how much the articles of a joumal have inlluenced the knowledge\nin a given subject area. We will display its raw value (AIFRaw) and the percentile value (AIFp).\nTo cater for diversity, we are taking 3 factors from Scimago website. SCImago is a research group\nftom the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Institute of Granada,\nExtremadura, Carlos III (Madrid) and Alcalii de Henares, dedicated to information analysis,\nrepresentation and retrieval by means of visualization techniques [http://www.scimagojr.com].c. Scimago ]ournal Rank (SJR)\nThe SJR indicator meaflres the scientific influence of the average article in a jouma! it expresses\nhow central to the global scientific discussion an average article of the joumal is and adapts Google\nPage Rank to measure it. We will display its raw value (SJRRaw) and the percentile value (SJRp)\nd. H-index\nThe H-index is a prestigious measure to determine the quality and quantity of research produced\nby a researcher, Journal and an institute. If H articles of a Joumal are cited at least H times each\nand the remaining articles are not cited more than H times, then H will be the H-index of a Joumal.\nWe will display its raw value (HIRaw) and the percentile value (HIp)\ne. Cites per Doc (CD2)\nCites per Doc in last 2 years measures the scienflfic impact of an average article published in the\njoumal, it is computed using the same formula that joumal impact factor rM (Thomson Reuters).\nWe will display its raw value (CD2Raw) and the percentile value (CD2p).\nf. Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP)\nThis indicator measures the average citation impact of the publications of a joumal. Unlike the\nwell-known joumal impact factor, SNIP corrects for differences in citation practices between\nscientific fields, thereby allowing for more accurate between-field comparisons of citation impact.\nThis measure is proposed by well-known CWTS Joumal Lrdicators Project\n[http://www.joumalindicators.com]. We will displaythe raw value(SNIPRaw) and the percentile\nvalue (SNIPp).\n6\n10. AUTHOR POSITION IN PUBLISHED ARTICLES FOR REWARD CLAIM\nFor the cash reward of published articles, Faculty members they are positioned till 5s author will\nbe eligible for the publication reward claim. No any reward shall be claimed by any author who\nis 6th or later position in the published article(s). Based on the authors' position in article(s), the\nreward will be given as per the following criteria:\n1,. 100% will be given to the 1st and 2nd position of author.\n2. 75% wtllbe given to the 3.a and 4h position of author.\n3. 50% will be given to the 5s position of author.\n4. No reward for the authors beyond 5tt position\nIn case of supervisor of PhD is on 2\"d number than the 100% reward will be given, among which\n50% will be given to supervisor and 50% to the student. Separate cheque will be given to the\nsupervisor and student.\n11. REWARD CLAIM FOR BOOKS & BOOK CHAPTERS\nThe Authored, Edited Books and Book chapters reward will be claimed based on the SENSE\ninternational books publishers ranking (A, B & C Category). Whereas, the position of authors in\nthe books as Editor or Author for the reward claim will be same as mentioned above. Moreover,\nPhD thesis published in the form of a book will not be considered under the policy (Not those\nextended versions of work can be corsidered for book chapter reward which has been published\nin any joumal article previously). Reward for book publication(s) has been classified as listed\nbelow:\nI Reward of Authored Book will be PKR 150,000\nr Reward of Edited Book will be PKR 100,000\no Reward of Book Chapter will be PKR 50,00G\n12. RE\"WARD CLAIM FOR PHD STUDENT\nIf PhD students publish an article in joumal that is entitled for the reward, the reward will be given\nas per following criteria: 50% of the reward willbe given to Supervisor, and 50% will be distributed\namongst the PhD students, as nominated by the supervisor. Furthermore, PhD students will not\nbe entitled for any reward claim if they publish article/paper on their own or without supervisor\nfrom Sukkur IBA University.\n13. FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR PRESENTING RESEARCH PAPER IN REPUTED\nNATIONAIINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE\nAny faculty member/PhD scholar whose research work has been accepted in a\nnational/international conference identified by the Sukkur IBA University Pool of Experfs, will\nbe sponsored by Sukkur IBA University to present his/her work in that conference. The Experts\nPanel may use the guidelines such as, acceptance rate i.e acceptance of fulllength papet and peer\nreview etc.\nFollowing are the important considerations as part of Sponsorship of research work presentation:\na. The University encourages faculty to budget conference travel as part of their funding\nprojects\nb. ln order to suppot faculty havel for conference participation as an author, the university\nwill budget a PKR 3 million in its annual budget.\nc. The maximum allowable amount for one conference travel is capped at PKR 300,000.\nHowever, it is essential to note that the actual amount granted (which must be less than or\nequal to the maximum limit) is subject to the approval of the Vice Chancellor based on the\nrecommendation of the Expert Panel.\n73 ln case more than one chapter, which is highly unlikely, but not full book, same 50,000 KR will be rewarded\nd. No support would be extended for conference participation only, authorship is mandatory\ne. Any application for travel support to ORIC Sukkur IBA University must be submitted after\nthe application is already submitted to HEC for travel support.\nf. The travel support is subject to conference proceedings indexing in Scopus, web of science,\nIEEE Explorer, ACM Digital Library, Springer and other reputable indexing services to be\ndetermined by the Expert Panel. No support would be extended for any conference travel\nwhich is not indexed in these reputable indexing repositories. The quality of any conference\nwould be determined by the Expert Panel.\ng. A11 the travel grant applications must be submitted to ORIC at least eight weeks before\nconference dates and should meet HEC Conference Travel Grant Criteria for\nrecommendation of approval.\nh. If the acceptance of papers is without a peer review and/or on submission of abstract only\nand acceptance is for poster presentatio4 the request for sponsorship will not be\nentertained.\ni. In case of multi-authored papers, the travel request to present paper will only be applicable\nfor the first author unless the first author is unable to present due to exceptional\ncircumstances beyond his/her control.j. All such requests must be forwarded to ORIC Sukkur IBA University soon after the author\nreceives the acceptance notification email, for processing and approval through his/her\ndepartment's HoD.\nk. All faculty members are required to submit the conlerence proceedings back to ORIC, to be\nplaced in ORIC central repository.\nl. During an academic year (July 1 to June 30), each faculty member is permitted to undertake\nonly one conference travel supported under SIBAU funding. This policy aims to ensure that\na greater number of faculty members have the opportunity to benefit from national and\nintemational exposure.\nm. ln case, a faculty members wins conference travel from other source, the travel on such\nconference is subject to the approval of Vice Chancellor on the recommendation of relevant\nHead of Department (HoD).\nn. The award of havel grant is subject to availability of funds.\n14. UNTVERSITY BEST RESEARCHER AWARD\nln order to encourage faculty members and to motivate them to perform better in future, the\nUniversity Best Researcher of the year Award will be given to faculty members in each individual\ndeparknents and at the University level. The award will consist of a cash prize of Rs 75,000 (Rupees\nSeventy Five Thousand only) for the individual departrren/s best researchers whereas Rs. 200,000\n(Rupees Two Hundred Thousand) for the University Best Researcher Award with a certificates of\nRecognition/ Appreciation signed by the Vice Chancellor.\nThe guidelines for the award are as follows:\na. Only data for the year'l under consideration will be applicable.\nb. Minimum 3 years' service as a regrrlar teachet at Sukkur IBA University.\nc. Minimum 4 courses for teaching in the concemed year/duration.\nd. A faculty member who has already received Best Researcher Award, will be re-considered\nfor this award after 3 years intervening period.\nA claim with insufficient documentary p be considered for poinfs calculation e,\n84 Year mean July 1 to June 30roof will\nf. Publications, proiects, research grants, patents, student supervision etc. related to Sukkur\nIBA University will only be considered.\ng. Following table shows scoring criteria for determining best researcher award. In each of\nthe category, maxirnum score is assigrred. Score for a particular category cannot be\ntransferred to other category. For example, even if a researcher publishes 5 research paper\nin joumals having JPI more than 90, the score earned would still be 25 as that is the\nmaximum score assigned to this category.\nh. Every year, during the first week of July, ORIC will issue a call for best researcher through\nfaculty domain email,\ni. The researchers have to submit the ORIC proforma within due datej. The ORIC Expert Panel to quantify score of each applicant and forward its\nrecommendation to the Vice Chancellor for approval\nk. After obtaining necessary approval, the ORIC will armounce the best researcher of the year\nby the end of July.\nS. No Criteria\nlJPI score (to be extracted\nfrom HEC HJRS) in a year\nfor all published and\naccepted papers which are\nnot counted in previous year.\nFor this parameter, a paper\nto be considered, the author\nmust be listed among top\nfive authors of the relevant\npaper.

Faculty  Designation  Number  of Duties  \n1 Lecturer  / Lab Engineer  n  \n2 Assistant  Professor  n-1 \n3 Associate  Professor  n-2 \n4 Professor  n-3 \n \nNote:  Here 'n' represents  the baseline  number  of duties  assigned  to a faculty  member,  determined  by the Examination  \nController  based on the overall  examination  needs and faculty  availability.  \n30.4 Procedure  of duty  assignment  \n \nInitial  Schedule  Design:  \na. The Examination  Controller  will create  an initial  invigilation  duty schedule  based  on the \ndesignated  criteria  and share  with HoD  before  15 days of Examination  \nb. The HoD  will review  the schedule  within  two working  days and provide  feedback  to ensure  \ndepartmen t-specific  considerations  are taken  into account.  \n \n c. The Examination  Controller  will communicate  the final invigilation  duty schedule  to all faculty  \nmembers  before  10 days of examination  schedule.  \nd. Faculty  members  are required  to confirm  their availability  and report  any conflicts  or concerns  to \nthe Head  of Department  with replacements  within  the two days of sharing  of schedule  \n \n30.5 Important  Considerations  \ng. Invigilation  duty is a high priority  task for faculty  members,  all the meetings  should  be \nscheduled  outside invigilation  duty times  \nh. The routine  meetings  must  be scheduled  outside  the invigilation  duty times.   \ni. Those  faculty  members  who are assigned  additional  charges  (Directors  etc.), thus reporting  \nto the Vice Chancellor  directly,  their teaching  role reporti ng is to the Head  of Department,  \ntherefore,  they must  schedule  any travel  or leave  in consultation  with HoDs.  Such  changes  \nshould  also be made  in CMS/ERP  so that leave  request  of such faculty  members  is \nrecommended  by the HoD  and approved  by the Vice Chanc ellor,  whereas  other  aspects  such \nas procurement  etc. for such faculty  members  will continue  to be in direct  reporting  to the \nVice Chancellor  \nj. All the efforts  will be made  by the examination  department  to reduce  the number  of blocks  \nduring  the examination  while preparing  the exam  schedule.  Mixing  of multiple  classes  in a \nsingle  room  is one such good  practice  to reduce  need of physical  space  as well as invigilators  \nk. Also,  effort  will be made  to figure  out possibilities  of one day break  during  course  exams,  \nsubject such effort  does not stretch  exam  days beyond  permissible  range  \nl. There  will be single  exam  schedule  for both Bachelor  and Master/PhD  programs  \nm. In case a faculty  member  is unable  to perform  his/her  invigilation  duty,  he/she  is responsible  \nto provide  the replacement  in consultation  with HoD.  The replacement  must  be a faculty  \nmember  or an officer  of grade  17 and above  \n \n \n \n \n  \n30.6 Conclusion  \nThis document  establishes  a structured  and transparent  process  for the assignment  of examination  \ninvigilation  duties.  The collaboration  between  the Examination  Controller  and the Head  of Department  \nensures  that the schedule  is fair, taking  into account  both institutional  and departmental  needs.  This \ndocument  is subject  to review  and updates  as needed.  \n "
